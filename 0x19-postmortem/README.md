# Postmortem

## My first postmortem

### **Issue Summary**

Duration: A harrowing 120 minutes, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM WAT (West African Time).

Impact: Users of our beloved e-commerce website experienced frustratingly slow page load times and some unlucky shoppers were unable to complete purchases during the outage. Approximately 20% of users were affected - a tragedy by any measure.

Root Cause: Alas, the cause of the calamity was simply an increase in traffic that overwhelmed our web application servers, causing slow response times and some requests to time out. We learned that even the mightiest of servers can succumb to the whims of the online shopping gods.

### **Timeline**

* 10:00 AM: Our monitoring system blew up with alerts, warning us of a massive influx of traffic to our website. "Oh boy, it's going to be a fun day!" we thought.
* 10:05 AM: One of our alert engineers noticed that the website was responding slower than a sloth on a lazy Sunday morning, and reported it to the team. We were in disbelief - our beloved website, our pride and joy, had succumbed to the online shopping hordes.
* 10:10 AM: We initially suspected that the issue was related to our load balancers and began investigating that area of the system. "It's gotta be those darned load balancers," we muttered under our breaths.
* 10:30 AM: We ruled out the load balancers as the cause and began investigating the web application servers. "Well, that's one theory out the window," we sighed.
* 11:00 AM: We discovered that the web application servers were experiencing a bottleneck due to the increased traffic. "Aha! We've got you now, you sneaky little bottleneck," we exclaimed.
* 11:15 AM: We attempted to scale up the number of web application servers, but the issue persisted. "Come on, servers, don't fail us now!" we pleaded.
* 11:30 AM: We called in the big guns - our DevOps team - to help us vanquish the online shopping gods. "We need you now more than ever, DevOps team!" we cried.
* 12:00 PM: The issue was finally resolved when the DevOps team discovered and fixed a misconfiguration in the server settings that had caused the bottleneck. "Hallelujah, it's a miracle!" we cheered.

### **Root Cause and Resolution**

The root cause of the issue was simply an increase in traffic that overwhelmed our web application servers, causing slow response times and some requests to time out. The issue was fixed by the DevOps team, who discovered and corrected a misconfiguration in the server settings that had caused the bottleneck. We also learned that sometimes, the simplest solutions can be the most effective - who knew?

### **Corrective and Preventative Measures**

To prevent future catastrophes, we have a few tricks up our sleeve:

* Scale up our web application servers in anticipation of traffic spikes. We'll be ready for anything!
* Add more monitoring and alerting to our systems to detect bottlenecks more quickly. "We've got our eyes on you, bottlenecks!"
* Conduct regular load testing to identify and address potential performance issues before they affect users. "Better safe than sorry!"
* Develop and implement a more robust disaster recovery plan to minimize the impact of future outages. "We're taking no chances!"

Tasks to Address the Issue:

* Review and optimize server settings to prevent similar configuration issues in the future. "We'll make those servers sing like birds!"
* Implement auto-scaling for web application servers to automatically adjust to traffic spikes. "Well, we could always just hire a bunch of interns to frantically spin up servers whenever traffic spikes, but I hear that's frowned upon in today's work culture. So instead, we'll implement auto-scaling like the responsible adults we are."
* Add additional monitoring and alerting for web application server performance. "Because let's face it, our current monitoring setup is about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. We need more alerts than a teenager's phone during a breakup."
* Conduct regular load testing to ensure adequate performance under high traffic conditions. "Because the last thing we want is our server performance to go down faster than a lead balloon. Let's make sure our application is as strong as Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in a tug-of-war."
* Develop and implement a comprehensive disaster recovery plan. "Because as the old saying goes, 'failure to plan is planning to fail.' And let's be honest, we don't want to be caught with our servers down when the apocalypse hits."
